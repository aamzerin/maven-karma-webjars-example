# Maven+Karma+Webjars

This is an example project that runs JavaScript unit tests (in this case [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) tests) driven by the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) test runner during a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) build. It also uses [Webjars](http://webjars.org) to manage web-resource dependencies.

This type of setup might be encountered in a Java service + Web UI project for example, or in an enterprise environment where CI builds are standardised around a Java + Maven workflow.
